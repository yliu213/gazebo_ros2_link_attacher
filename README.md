# gazebo_ros2_link_attacher

This repository provides a simple ROS2 Humble implementation of the main functionality of the original [gazebo_ros_link_attacher](https://github.com/pal-robotics/gazebo_ros_link_attacher/tree/melodic-devel).

It is currently functional for basic link attachment and detachment in Gazebo Classic.  
Users are encouraged to adapt the provided `attach_sls.py` script to fit their specific use cases.
